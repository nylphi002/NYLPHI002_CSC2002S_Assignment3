# NYLPHI002_CSC2002S_Assignment3

This program analyzes input data from a weather simulation, containing a grid of wind vectors and uplift for some number of points in time, and calculates the prevailing wind and what types of clouds are created by these factors. 

The program supports both parallel and sequential calculation/classification of the input data. The parallel program is set to the default starting method but this can be changed by using block comment on the part that #the user wants to be inactive.
