 * Main is the class used to run and test both the sequential

 * It uses the class {@link CloudData} to perform and time sequential operations while 
 * {@link CloudDataParallel} is used to run the operations with parallel algorithms. 
 * <P>
 * Block 2 should be surrounded with a block comment to run the program sequential and block 1 surrounded to run it parallel.
 * <P>
 * CloudData and CloudDataParallel are never active at the same time, they are
 * tested separately to avoid corrupt measurements and the first five runs are 
 * not measured in both cases.
